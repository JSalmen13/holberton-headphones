## Holberton Headphones Project

In this project, we will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page based on a design model given on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/gkWRcFqkwtruWZgSfnnHF0/Holberton-School---Headphone-company)
We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that we learned previously.

## Main Goal

Functionnal web page identical to the designer's creation
Use of all knowledge that we learned previously
Having fun developing this piece of art

## Requirements

- we are not allowed to import external CSS framework
- we are not allowed to use Javascript
- everything builds up from scratch 

## Interactions note

- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: #FF6565
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

## Foundation

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom
- avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
